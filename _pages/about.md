## Hi, thanks for stopping by! 😉🎶😊

👋 I'm **Tingting Dan** . A Post-Doc Research Associate supervised by [Dr. Guorong Wu](https://www.acmlab.org/team) at UNC-Chapel Hill. I got my PhD degree at South China University of Technology advised by [Prof. Guorong Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XVsMB2kAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Hongmin Cai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=B2BWq_EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests cover geometric deep learning, graph learning, computational neuroscience, machine learning and neuroimage data analysis.
